User: I've been working in product engineering for about 7 years now. I started as a junior developer 
        and worked my way up to senior staff engineer. I've led multiple teams, built scalable systems 
        handling millions of requests, and have experience with Golang, Python, Node.js, AWS, Kafka, Redis, 
        and Postgres. I'm particularly proud of the communication platform I built at Simpl, which reduced 
        costs by 40% while improving latency.
