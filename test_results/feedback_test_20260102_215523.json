    "summary": "The interview highlighted a solid background in product engineering, but there were gaps in communication and technical depth. The lack of code submissions limited the assessment of coding skills.",
    "detailed_feedback": "While you have a strong foundation in product engineering and relevant experience, the interview revealed some areas for improvement. Your communication was somewhat limited, which made it challenging to gauge your thought process and technical depth. Additionally, without code submissions, we couldn't assess your coding style or quality. It would be beneficial to articulate your experiences more clearly and provide examples of your problem-solving approach. Overall, your leadership experience is commendable, but enhancing your communication and technical demonstration will be crucial for future interviews.",
    "recommendations": [
      "Practice articulating your experiences and thought processes more clearly during interviews",
      "Engage in mock interviews to improve communication skills and gain confidence",
      "Provide code samples or projects to showcase your coding abilities and style",
      "Focus on deepening your technical knowledge in areas relevant to the role",
      "Consider preparing specific examples of challenges faced and how you solved them to demonstrate problem-solving skills"
