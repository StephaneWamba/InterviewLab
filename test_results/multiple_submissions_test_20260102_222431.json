  "feedback_1": "Great job on correctly handling the base cases for Fibonacci numbers! To improve, I recommend implementing the logic for calculating Fibonacci numbers greater than 1, as well as adding input validation for negative and non-integer values. Keep up the good work, and I\u2019m excited to see how you can enhance this function further!\n\nNote: I notice you submitted code that doesn't match the exercise I provided (You are tasked with building a simple task management system. Write a function that takes a list of ...). I'll review what you submitted, but I'd also like to see your solution to the original exercise when you're ready.\n\nHow would you implement input validation for negative numbers and non-integer values?",
