To improve, consider optimizing your recursive approach for larger values of n and adding comments to clarify your logic, as well as handling edge cases like negative inputs. You're on the right track\u2014keep up the good work!\n\nNote: I notice you submitted code that doesn't match the exercise I provided (Design a simple RESTful API for managing a collection of books in a library. The API should support ...). I'll review what you submitted, but I'd also like to see your solution to the original exercise when you're ready.\n\nHow would you implement input validation to handle negative numbers in your function?",
