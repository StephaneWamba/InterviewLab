  "agent_feedback": "Great job implementing the basic CRUD operations for your book API using Flask! I noticed that while your code is well-structured and readable, it could benefit from adding input validation and error handling for required fields. Also, considering a more efficient data structure or a database would help improve scalability as your dataset grows. Keep up the good work!\n\nNote: I notice you submitted code that doesn't match the exercise I provided (Design a RESTful API for a simple task management system that allows users to create, retrieve, upda...). I'll review what you submitted, but I'd also like to see your solution to the original exercise when you're ready.\n\nHow would you implement input validation for the API to ensure all required fields are present?",
