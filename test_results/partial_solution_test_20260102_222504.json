  "agent_feedback": "Great job on establishing the basic structure of your Flask application, especially with the correctly implemented GET endpoint for retrieving books! To enhance your project, I recommend focusing on implementing the POST endpoint for adding books, ensuring the Flask module is properly set up, and incorporating error handling and input validation to make your application more robust. Keep up the good work, and I\u2019m excited to see how you improve it!\n\nNote: I notice you submitted code that doesn't match the exercise I provided (Implement a simple in-memory key-value store that supports basic operations: set, get, and delete. T...). I'll review what you submitted, but I'd also like to see your solution to the original exercise when you're ready.\n\nHow would you implement input validation for the data being posted to the /books endpoint?",
